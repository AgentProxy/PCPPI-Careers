        		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It was a hot and humid day in New Born, North Carolina. So a young pharmacist named Caleb Bradham began experimenting with combinations of spices, juices, and syrups trying to create a refreshing new drink to serve his customers. He succeeded beyond all expectations inventing the beverage now known around the world as Pepsi-Cola.<br><br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Pepsi-Cola came to the Philippines through John Clarkin, a native of Minnesota, USA who came with the American forces at the close of World War II. On October 16, 1946, Clarkin acquired a franchise to bottle Pepsi in the Philippines. He consequently founded the Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company of the Philippine Islands Ltd. and became its president and general manager.<br><br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The company imported Pepsi beverages from the U.S. for a year until its first bottling plant was established in Quezon City in 1947.<br><br> 
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In 1957, Clarkin returned to the U.S. and PepsiCo International took over Pepsi’s operations in the country. The company became a branch of PepsiCo’s New York office in 1983 and was renamed as PepsiCo Inc. (Philippine Branch).<br>

        		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp From 1979 to 1981, the company flourished under PCI’s administration and Pepsi dominated the market with the share of more than 60%. The success was mainly fueled by an aggressive marketing program dubbed “Have a Pepsi Day” and the launching of Mountain Dew.  <br><br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The year 1985 marked a new milestone for the company. The group named Pepsi-Cola Distributors of the Philippines, Inc. led by the Escalers, acquired its franchising and bottling rights and officially made the company a Filipino corporation. <br><br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It was not long before the company drew the attention of Luis Lorenzo Sr. and his partners, the AFP-RSBS. Through their group under Premier Beverages, they bought and assumed majority and ownership of Pepsi Philippines in 1989 and gave it a new name: Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, Inc. (PCPPI) which has remained the company’s proud handle since then.<br>
